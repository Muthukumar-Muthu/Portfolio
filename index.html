            <p>I‚Äôm a Web Developer based in Adelaide, Australia. Even though I have a Telecommunications Engineering
                degree and an MBA,
                coding is my passion and my new professional career focus. Developing applications for the web has
                become my drive.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>This project was one of my favourite tools for breaking my way out of tutorial hell üëπ. I also
                        wanted
                        this project to serve me as a display of my JavaScript skills to potential employers or
                        collaborators.</p>
                    <p>By the time I decided to start working on this project I had just finished learning about
                        Promises,
                        async...await, APIs and error handling. I wanted to code a project to implement all of this
                        knowledge.</p>
                    <h4>Lessons learned</h4>
                    <p>At the start, this project seemed simple, but it quickly got complicated, especially because I
                        was
                        dealing with three different APIs (and a couple more that didn‚Äôt work in the end).</p>
                    <p>I didn‚Äôt spend much time on HTML, but CSS proved to be demanding once more üòÖ. Thanks to the
                        challenges I faced I gain more CSS skills and learned how to better debug it.</p>
                    <p>Regarding JavaScript, I could have implemented MVC from the get-go, so I will do that in my next
                        project. As I previously said, I prefer not to refactor this project and leave it as a witness
                        of my
                        skills at the time.</p>
                    <p>APIs are reliable‚Ä¶ most of the time ü§≠. I‚Äôm sure paid APIs perform better, so if I need to use
                        them
                        in the future for a more serious project, I will research deeply what is the best API to get for
                        the
                        job.</p>
                    <p>This project still has room for improvement, but I had to make the decision to stop working on it
                        at
                        some point. Overall, I think it‚Äôs functioning as expected.</p>

                <h1>Hammering down React basics, with a paint coat of Material UI</h1>
                <p>This project is an excuse to practice React basic concepts and to experiment with Material UI. I will
                    be building a
                    simple application to build a list of favourite books üìö.
                </p>
                <p>In the past, I was used to coding with an imperative approach: stating line by line all the necessary
                    steps the program
                    needed to execute in order to achieve the desired outcome. With JavaScript, and especially with
                    React, this mindset is
                    changing, moving towards a declarative paradigm. I no longer state line by line what needs to be
                    done, but the end
                    results I‚Äôm pursuing.
                </p>
                <p>This declarative approach is still new for me, and it‚Äôs taking me some work to get used to it, but
                    I‚Äôm feeling more
                    comfortable with it. (...)</p>

            <p>My interest in technology started when I was a teenager and dial-up Internet connections were booming. I
                still remember
                plugging in a 10 metres telephone cable to my PC from the phone box every night to avoid keeping my
                family‚Äôs phone line
                busy during peak hours.</p>
            <p>In those days I started playing with Linux as well, thanks to a book about the Slackware distro that I
                bought and came
                with a set of floppy disks. I right away noticed the importance of having a backup of your files,
                because I ended up
                formatting the hard drive multiple times due to the learning process.</p>
            <p>Around the same time, I also started playing with scripting on several IRC programs. In those days,
                social networks as
                we know them today didn‚Äôt exist, so the ‚Äúchat rooms‚Äù were the closest we could get.</p>
